# A Toy Database

Here is a toy database which models an online music store.  In this database, we have falling into three categories: information about the company, information about customers and their orders, and information about the products being sold.

You'll be editing the `queries.sql` file, which consists of a series of "plain English" sentences.  Your job is to translate those sentences into a single SQL `SELECT` query.  Don't worry if you can't do it — take your best shot!

We've set up our own PostgreSQL server that you'll be connecting to.

## SQL And Relational Databases

SQL stands for **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage. It's a special-purpose language for interacting with relational databases (sometimes called SQL databases). Examples of relational databases include PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle.

Relational databases were developed in the 1970s as a standardized way of organizing information. Because every relational databases organizes information in a similar way, we can use a standard language (SQL) to query the data.

Every relational database has its own "dialect" of SQL, but they all share a common core. There's a "standard" dialect called ANSI SQL, which PostgreSQL goes out of its way to respect.

Keep this in mind when you're looking up resources. A tutorial for MySQL or Microsoft SWL Server can't be used directly in PostgreSQL, although the differences are often minor.

## Exercises

The exercises are contained in individual `.sql` files. They are meant to be completed in the following order:

1. `queries.sql` — Basic SQL queries on a single table
1. `group_by.sql` — Single-table queries using `GROUP BY`
1. `join.sql` — Two-table queries using `JOIN`
1. `left_join.sql` — Two-table queries using `LEFT JOIN`
1. `multi_join.sql` — Queries against more than two tables simultaneously

## Installing PostgreSQL

### Mac

You can install PostgreSQL on a Mac with `brew`:

```console
brew install postgresql
```

Once installed, start the database server with

```console
brew services start postgresql
```

### Windows

Follow the instructions here to install PostgreSQL on Windows: <https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql/>

Once installed, you have to add PostgreSQL's `bin` directory to your PATH environment variable. Search for *Edit system environment variable* to open *System Properties*. From there, click the *Environment Variables* button.

Under *User variables*, click the row labeled *Path* and then click the *Edit...* button. Click *New* and add the following directory to the PATH environment variable:

```text
C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\13\bin
```

Note that the `13` here refers to the version of PostgreSQL that you installed. If you installed a different version, you'd use a different number. PostgreSQL v13 is the current version *as of writing this*!

You can navigate to `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL` and see what folders are present.

## Using PostgreSQL

### Connecting To PostgreSQL

Connect to database by running this in your terminal:

```console
psql -h sql-exercises.20bits.com -U student sql_exercises
```

You will be prompted for a password. Ask your instructor for this information.

Once inside, type the following at the PostgreSQL prompt

```console
sql_exercises> \dt
```

to list all the tables in the database.  To see the schema for a specific table, e.g., the `invoices` table, you can use PostgreSQL's `\d` command:

```console
sql_exercises> \d invoices
```

If you see a colon `:` at the bottom of the screen, that means there's more to see. You can scroll up and down using the arrow keys. You can exit the scrolling interface by pressing the `q` key.

Don't be afraid to explore the data in the tables to get a better feeling for how it's formatted.  It's impossible to damage your database as long as you're only running `SELECT` queries.  For example, what does the data in the invoices table look like?  Well, let's look at a 5 rows

```sql
SELECT * FROM invoices LIMIT 5;
```
\q
That's what we mean by "explore."

### Exiting The PostgreSQL Shell

When you're ready to exit the PostgreSQL shell you can press `Ctrl+D` or run the following command:

```console
\q
```

## The Database Tables

Relational databases are organized into tables. Each table looks like a single page in a spreadsheet, with rows and columns, but rather than thinking of it as a big "grid", it's best to think of it as a list of rows. Each row is an entry in the database.

Some key differences between a database and a spreadsheet:

1. Every column (or field) has a name
1. We can put constraints on the data in each row, so that only valid data can be inserted (e.g., only numbers, only text)
1. The data doesn't exist in any particular order in the database. The data just "exists" and we use SQL queries to get different views into the data.

A database can have many tables. The database "schema" is the structural description of the datbase. What tables are in the database? What fields does each table have? What constraints are there on the data that can be present in each row?

Here are the tables, organized by high-level purpose.

### Information About The Products

1. `albums` are the albums our store is selling
2. `artists` are all the artists
3. `tracks` are all the tracks, containing a column that tells us which album the track belongs to.
4. `media_types` tell us what format a track is in, e.g., MP3, Apple Audio, etc.
5. `genres` are a list of genres.
6. `playlists` are, well, playlists.  A play list has many tracks and a single track can belong to many playlists.
7. `playlist_tracks` tells us which tracks belong to which playlists

### Information About Customers and Their Orders

1. `customers` are our customer records and they may or may not have an assigned "customer support representative"
2. `invoices` are a list of specific customer orders
3. `invoice_lines` are the line-items on specific invoices

### Information About The Company

1. `employees` contains information about our company's employees.  This is mostly used to assign support representatives to customers.

## Key Idea: How SQL Queries Are Evaluated

Every SQL query consists of many clauses glued together. Some clauses are required, others are optional. Some can appear only once, others can appear multiple times.

Each clause is designated by a SQL keyword. For example, this query has two clauses: a `SELECT` clause and a `FROM` clause.

```sql
SELECT * FROM albums;
```

Each clause can only appear in certain locations in a query. In general, the order of clauses as written goes like this:

```text
SELECT
FROM and JOIN
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
ORDER BY
LIMIT
```

You're not familiar with all these clauses (yet), but you will be soon enough.

The order you should think about them is different than the order you write them, though. You should think about the clauses in a query in the following order:

```text
FROM + JOIN
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
SELECT
ORDER BY
LIMIT
```

## Key Idea: Normalization

One of the key ideas in how relational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL organize data is that we try to minimize redundancy by using references to other data rather than duplicating that data between different tables.

For example, every track belongs to one (and only one) album.  An album has its own associated information, like album title, publication date, and so on.  Each track also has its own associated information, like track title, track position, and duration.  We want to be able to ask questions like "What is the title of the album on which track X appears?"

If you imagine a spreadsheet with a bunch of track listings, one way to achieve this would be to have an "Album Title" column and to answer this question we would just look at the value in the "Album Title" column for track X.  Every track on the same album would have the same value in the "Album Title" column, although heaven help us if there are two separate albums with the same title!

This is not how we store information in a relational database.  Rather than storing album-related information in the same table as track-related information, we store album-related information in an "albums" table and track-related information in a "tracks" table.  We assign each track and album a unique ID.  In the "tracks" table we would when have an `album_id` column containing the unique album ID as a *reference* or *pointer* to the relevant row in the "albums" table.

Excel can do this, but it is too cumbersome for the most common tasks.  In a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL, however, it is much easier to deal with.  In fact, SQL (the language) is counting on you storing your data this way.
