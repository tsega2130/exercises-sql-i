-- Outline
--
-- So far, we've been talking about joins using the JOIN keyword. This is
-- just one type of join, called an INNER JOIN.  In fact, wherever we've
-- been using the "JOIN" keyword we could instead replace it with "INNER JOIN"
-- without changing anything.
--
-- There's a second type of join, called a left join or left outer join.
-- It's a bit difficult to explain, but here are some blog posts:
--   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/448023/what-is-the-difference-between-left-right-outer-and-inner-joins
--   http://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/

-- Compare the output of these queries:
-- JOIN
SELECT employees.id, employees.first_name, employees.last_name,
       COUNT(DISTINCT(customers.id)) AS customers_served
FROM employees
JOIN customers
  ON (employees.id = customers.support_rep_id)
GROUP BY employees.id;

-- LEFT JOIN
SELECT employees.id, employees.first_name, employees.last_name,
       COUNT(DISTINCT(customers.id)) AS customers_served
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN customers
  ON (employees.id = customers.support_rep_id)
GROUP BY employees.id;

-- Note: Unlike JOIN, with a LEFT JOIN it does matter which table comes first.
-- That is,
--   FROM TableA LEFT JOIN TableB
-- **IS NOT THE SAME AS**
--   FROM TableB LEFT JOIN TableA

-- In any join (inner, left, or anything else) there are three components:
--   1. The left table
--   2. The right table
--   3. The join condition
-- An INNER JOIN returns only those rows from the left and right tables that
-- match the join condition.  A LEFT join returns all rows from the left table
-- no matter what, and any rows from the right table that match the join condition.
-- In other words, in an INNER JOIN, if a table in the left row doesn't have
-- a corresponding row in the right table then that row (in the left table)
-- won't be returned, whereas it WILL be returned in the result set using
-- a LEFT JOIN.

-- You can see this in the COUNT queries above, but more clearly, here:
-- This will return nothing since there are no customers who have Employee #1
-- as a customer service rep.  Remember, "INNER JOIN" is the same as "JOIN"
SELECT *
FROM employees
INNER JOIN customers
  ON (employees.id = customers.support_rep_id)
WHERE employees.id = 1;

-- This will return a SINGLE row, even though there are no corresponding customers.
-- The fields from the customers table are displayed as empty (or NULL), telling
-- us that Employee #1 has no associated customers.
SELECT *
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN customers
  ON (employees.id = customers.support_rep_id)
WHERE employees.id = 1;

-- Employees is the left table, customers is the right table, and the join
-- condition is employees.id = customers.support_rep_id.

-- One handy thing is that this allows us to create queries like...
-- Show me all employees who don't support any customers

SELECT *
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN customers
  ON (employees.id = customers.support_rep_id)
WHERE customers.id IS NULL;

-- There are no exercises, here, because the toy database doesn't have
-- interesting enough data to merit the use of LEFT JOINs in many contexts.
-- For example, this query would return all customers who had yet to make an
-- order.  In the toy database, there are no such customers, alas!

SELECT *
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN invoices
  ON (invoices.customer_id = customers.id)
WHERE invoices.id IS NULL;

--I understand the structure and the benefit of join but im having trouble creating queries of mine or approaching solving one 
--if i didnt have a precdeing pattern that i was following here then i think it would be more difficult 
--should my strategy be figuring out what data fields i need and using the order to structure them?
